# CHATVERSE-REAL-TIME-APPLICATION
This dissertation describes the process of the development of a chat application for 
developers, from a mere idea to a working cloud service. A real time platform that makes 
it easy to have a group conversation between a projects’ members, share code and stay 
up to date with their latest repository updates. Chatting is a method of using technology 
to bring people and ideas together despite of the geographical barriers. The technology 
has been available for years but the acceptance was quite recent. 
This project is an example of a chat server. It is made up of two applications - the client
application, which runs on the user’s web browser and server application, runs on any 
hosting servers on the network. To start chatting client should get connected to server 
where they can do private and group chat.
